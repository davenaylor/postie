<h3>Installation</h3>
	<ul>
<li>Either:

<ul>
<li>Put the postie.zip file in wp-content/plugins/ and unzip it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Or:

<ul>
<li>Use the automatic installer (WP 2.7+)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Login to WordPress as an administrator</li>
<li>Goto the Plugins tab in the WordPress Admin Site</li>
<li>Activate "Postie"</li>
<li>Goto to the "Settings" tab and click on the sub-tab "Configure Postie" to configure it.</li>
<li>Make sure you enter the mailserver information correctly, including the type
of connection and the port number. Common port configurations:

<ul>
<li>pop3: 110 </li>
<li>pop3-ssl: 995</li>
<li>imap: 143</li>
<li>imap-ssl: 993</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Postie ignores the settings under Settings-&gt;Writing-&gt;Writing-by-Email)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Automating checking e-mail</h4>

<p>If your site runs on a UNIX/linux server, and you have shell access, you can
enable mail checking using cron; if you don't know anything about cron, skip
to the cronless postie section.</p>

<p>Setup a cronjob to pull down the get_mail.php
Examples:</p>

<p>*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --source http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get_mail.php &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p>

<p>This fetches the mail every five minutes with lynx </p>

<p>*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O /dev/null http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get_mail.php &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p>

<p>This fetches the mail every ten minutes with wget </p>

<h4>Cronless Postie</h4>

<p>If you don't have access to cron, you can run postie without it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Activate the cronless postie plugin (it is included with the postie plugin,
so if you have downloaded postie, you don't need to download anything else</li>
<li>By default, cronless postie checks for new e-mail once every hour. To select
a different rate, change the cronless postie setting in the postie settings
page. </li>
<li>Note that timing with cronless postie is not very accurate. It depends
on people visiting your website. If you select to check every 10 minutes, but
you only get one visit every 30 minutes, then it might take 30 minutes for a
post to show up.</li>

<h4>1.1.1</h4>

<p>Below is all the of the version information. As far as I can tell there once was a guy named John Blade. He took some of the orignal wp-mail.php code and started hacking away on it. He actually got pretty far. About the time I discovered WordPress and his little hack - called WP-Mail at the time - he went on a vacation or something. There were some problems with the script, and it was missing some features I wanted. I hacked away at it and got it into a place where it did what I wanted. I started posting about it since I figured other people might want the features. </p>

<p>John didn't release any more versions at least up til July 2005. So I started accepting submissions and feature requests from people to help make the code better. In June/July 2005 I discovered a little plugin by Chris J Davis (http://www.chrisjdavis.org/cjd-notepad/) called notepad. I added a small feature to it (basically a bookmarklet).  In the process I started looking at his code and realized how much you could do with the plugin system available in Word Press.</p>

<p>So I decided to make an offical fork. I put up an article on my blog asking for new names. I picked Postie.  I then modified the code to be a proper plugin.  And the rest is history :)

<h4>0.1 - 2004-06</h4>

<ul>
<li>First release</li>
</ul>	<hr />
	
	<h3>Options and Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can set the starting characters for you signature so that it
is removed from the posting message</li>
<li>You can set a list of banned file names so if you provider adds
images to your post they don't show up in the blog</li>
<li>If you post from an email address that is not a valid author the
email post will be forwarded to the admin</li>
<li>You can control if you want HTML allowed in the body or subject
of your post</li>
<li>Lets you set a default subject when you don't set one</li>
<li>Defaults to posting to the default category you set in Word Press</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you put in :start - the message processing won't start until it sees that string</li>
<li>If you put in :end - the message processing will stop once it sees that string</li>
<li>Posts can be delayed by adding a line with delayXdXhXm where X is a number.

<ul>
<li>delay:1d - 1 day</li>
<li>delay:1h - 1 hour</li>
<li>delay:1m - 1 minute</li>
<li>delay:1d2h4m - 1 day 2 hours 4m</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By putting comments:X in your message you can control if comments are allowed

<ul>
<li>comments:0 - means closed</li>
<li>comments:1 - means open</li>
<li>comments:2 - means registered only</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Replying to an e-mail gets posted as a comment. 

<ul>
<li>For example, you e-mailed a post with the subject line "foo".
If you then send an e-mail with the subject line "Re: foo", it will
get posted as a comment to the "foo" post. This works by the subject
line, so if you have two posts with titles "foo", then the comment
will get placed in the more recent post.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Custom excerpt

<ul>
<li>You can include a custom excerpt of an e-mail by putting it between
:excerptstart and :excerptend</li>
<li>You can include images in the excerpt by using the shortcode #eimg1#,
#eimg2# etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Category and tag handling</h4>

<ul>
<li>If you put a category name in the subject with a : it will be used
as the category for the post</li>
<li>If you put a category id number in the subject with a : it will
be used as the category for the post</li>
<li><p>If you put the first part of a category name it will be posted in
the first category that the system finds that matches - so if you put</p>

<p>Subject: Gen: New News</p>

<p>The system will post that in General.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the above also applies if you put the category in brackets []</p></li>
<li><p>Using [] or you can post to multiple categories at once</p>

<p>Subject: [1] [Mo] [Br] My Subject</p>

<p>On my blog it would post to General (Id 1), Moblog, and Brewing all at one time</p></li>
<li><p>Using - or you can post to multiple categories at once</p>

<p>Subject: -1- -Mo- -Br- My Subject</p>

<p>On my blog it would post to General (Id 1), Moblog, and Brewing all at one time</p></li>
<li>You can add tags by adding a line in the body of the message like so:
tags: foo, bar</li>
<li>You can also set a default tag to be applied if no tags are included.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Image Handling</h4>

<ul>
<li>Allows you to attach images to your email and automatically post
them to your blog</li>
<li>You can publish images in the text of your message by using #img1#
#img2# - each one will be replaced with the HTML for the image
you attached</li>
<li><p>Captions - you can also add a caption like so:</p>

img1 caption='foo'

img2 caption='bar'

<p>Or, if you use IPTC captions, this caption will be used  (adding a caption
in many photo editing programs (for example Picasa), will add an IPTC caption)</p></li>
<li><p>Image templates
Postie now uses the default wordpress image template, but you can specify a
different one if you wish.</p>

<p>You can also specify a custom image template. I use the following custom
template:</p>

<p>&lt;div class='imageframe alignleft'&gt;&lt;a href='{IMAGE}'&gt;&lt;img src="{THUMBNAIL}"
alt="{CAPTION}" title="{CAPTION}" 
class="attachment" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div
class='imagecaption'&gt;{CAPTION}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<ul>
<li>{THUMBNAIL} gets replaced with the url to the thumbnail image</li>
<li>{MEDIUM} gets replaced with the url to the medium-sized image</li>
<li>{LARGE} gets replaced with the url to the large-sized image</li>
<li>{FULL} gets replaced with the url to the full-sized image</li>
<li>{FILENAME} gets replaced with the absolute path to the full-size image</li>
<li>{RELFILENAME} gets replaced with the relative path to the full-size image</li>
<li>{CAPTION} gets replaced with the caption you specified (if any)</li>
<li>{WIDTH} gets replaced with width of the photo</li>
<li>{HEIGHT} gets replaced with the height of the photo</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Interoperability</h4>

<ul>
<li>If your mail client doesn't support setting the subject (nokia) you
can do so by putting #your title here# at the begining of your message</li>
<li>POP3,POP3-SSL,IMAP,IMAP-SSL now supported - last three require
php-imap support</li>
<li>The program understands enough about mime to not duplicate post
if you send an HTML and plain text message</li>
<li>Automatically confirms that you are installed correctly</li>
</ul>
