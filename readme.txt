videos, and automatically strip off signatures. It also has support for both

      * Removed debugging info in get_mail.php (security issue) thanks to 
        [Jens]( http://svalgaard.net/jens/)
      * No longer directly including pluggable.php (should
        prevent conflicts with other plugins such as registerplus

== Installation ==
* Make sure all postie code is its own directory inside of wp-content/plugins/postie
* Make two directories in your main wordpress directory wp-filez and wp-photos
* Make sure these directories are writable by your web server (chmod 777 or chown to the webserver -- the permissions should be the same as wp-content/uploads)
* make sure that the postie directory  that this file is in is moved to yourwebsite/wp-content/plugins
* Login to WordPress as an administrator
* Goto the Plugins tab in the WordPress Admin Site
* Activate "Postie"
* Goto to the "Settings" tab and click on the sub-tab "Configure Postie" to configure it.
* Make sure you enter the mailserver information correctly, including the type
  of connection and the port number. Common port configurations:
  * pop3: 110 
  * pop3-ssl: 995
  * imap: 143
  * imap-ssl: 993
* (Postie ignores the settings under Settings->Writing->Writing-by-Email)

= Automating checking e-mail =

If your site runs on a UNIX/linux server, and you have shell access, you can
enable mail checking using cron; if you don't know anything about cron, skip
to the cronless postie section.

Setup a cronjob to pull down the get\_mail.php
Examples:

*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --source http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get\_mail.php >/dev/null 2>&1

This fetches the mail every five minutes with lynx 

*/10 * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O /dev/null http://blog.robfelty.com/wp-content/plugins/postie/get\_mail.php >/dev/null 2>&1

This fetches the mail every ten minutes with wget 

= Cronless Postie =

If you don't have access to cron, you can run postie without it.

* Activate the cronless postie plugin (it is included with the postie plugin,
  so if you have downloaded postie, you don't need to download anything else
* By default, cronless postie checks for new e-mail once every hour. To select
  a different rate, change the cronless postie setting in the postie settings
  page. 
* Note that timing with cronless postie is not very accurate. It depends
  on people visiting your website. If you select to check every 10 minutes, but
  you only get one visit every 30 minutes, then it might take 30 minutes for a
  post to show up.

== Options and Settings ==

* You can set the starting characters for you signature so that it
  is removed from the posting message
* You can set a list of banned file names so if you provider adds
  images to your post they don't show up in the blog
* If you post from an email address that is not a valid author the
  email post will be forwarded to the admin
* You can control if you want HTML allowed in the body or subject
  of your post
* Lets you set a default subject when you don't set one
* Defaults to posting to the default category you set in Word Press

== Usage ==
* If you put in :start - the message processing won't start until it sees that string
* If you put in :end - the message processing will stop once it sees that string
* Posts can be delayed by adding a line with delayXdXhXm where X is a number.
  *    delay:1d - 1 day
  *    delay:1h - 1 hour
  *    delay:1m - 1 minute
  *    delay:1d2h4m - 1 day 2 hours 4m
* By putting comments:X in your message you can control if comments are allowed
   *   comments:0 - means closed
   *   comments:1 - means open
   *   comments:2 - means registered only
* Replying to an e-mail gets posted as a comment. 
  * For example, you e-mailed a post with the subject line "foo".
    If you then send an e-mail with the subject line "Re: foo", it will
    get posted as a comment to the "foo" post. This works by the subject
    line, so if you have two posts with titles "foo", then the comment
    will get placed in the more recent post.
* Custom excerpt
  * You can include a custom excerpt of an e-mail by putting it between
    :excerptstart and :excerptend
    * You can include images in the excerpt by using the shortcode #eimg1#,
      #eimg2# etc.

= Category and tag handling =
* If you put a category name in the subject with a : it will be used
  as the category for the post
* If you put a category id number in the subject with a : it will
  be used as the category for the post
* If you put the first part of a category name it will be posted in
  the first category that the system finds that matches - so if you put

  Subject: Gen: New News

  The system will post that in General.

* All of the above also applies if you put the category in brackets []
* Using [] or you can post to multiple categories at once

  Subject: [1] [Mo] [Br] My Subject

  On my blog it would post to General (Id 1), Moblog, and Brewing all at one time

* Using - or you can post to multiple categories at once

  Subject: -1- -Mo- -Br- My Subject

  On my blog it would post to General (Id 1), Moblog, and Brewing all at one time
* You can add tags by adding a line in the body of the message like so:
  tags: foo, bar
* You can also set a default tag to be applied if no tags are included.

= Image Handling =
* Postie has a filter to make it easy to show full images on individual pages.
* Tells you if you have GD installed for resizing images
* Allows you to attach images to your email and automatically post
  them to your blog
* Large images are automatically thumbnailed and linked to the larger
  image (Requires GD)
* You can publish images in the text of your message by using #img1#
  #img2# - each one will be replaced with the HTML for the image
  you attached
* Captions - you can also add a caption like so:
  #img1 caption='foo'#
  #img2 caption='bar'#
  
  Or, if you use IPTC captions, this caption will be used  (adding a caption
  in many photo editing programs (for example Picasa), will add an IPTC caption)

* Image templates
  By default, postie wraps images in a div. You can specify the class of
  the div in the options. You can also choose whether or not to open the
  full-size image in a new window.

  You can also specify a custom image template. I use the following custom
template:

  &lt;div class='imageframe alignleft'&gt;&lt;a href='{IMAGE}'&gt;&lt;img src="{THUMBNAIL}"
  alt="{CAPTION}" title="{CAPTION}" 
  class="attachment" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div
class='imagecaption'&gt;{CAPTION}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     
    * {IMAGE} gets replaced with the url to the full-size image
    * {THUMBNAIL} gets replaced with the url to the thumbnail image
    * {FILENAME} gets replaced with the absolute path to the full-size image
    * {RELFILENAME} gets replaced with the relative path to the full-size image
    * {CAPTION} gets replaced with the caption you specified (if any)
    * {WIDTH} gets replaced with the maximum width for resized photos
    * {HEIGHT} gets replaced with the maximum height for resized photos

* Rotation - if you include the text

  rotate:90

  or any other number - all images in the message will be rotated for you.

* Images are renamed in a way that makes it impossible to accidentally
  overwrite images you have already posted



= Interoperability =
* If your mail client doesn't support setting the subject (nokia) you
  can do so by putting #your title here# at the begining of your message
* POP3,POP3-SSL,IMAP,IMAP-SSL now supported - last three require
  php-imap support
* The program understands enough about mime to not duplicate post
  if you send an HTML and plain text message
* Automatically confirms that you are installed correctly

Below is all the of the version information. As far as I can tell there once was a guy named John Blade. He took some of the orignal wp-mail.php code and started hacking away on it. He actually got pretty far. About the time I discovered WordPress and his little hack - called WP-Mail at the time - he went on a vacation or something. There were some problems with the script, and it was missing some features I wanted. I hacked away at it and got it into a place where it did what I wanted. I started posting about it since I figured other people might want the features. 

John didn't release any more versions at least up til July 2005. So I started accepting submissions and feature requests from people to help make the code better. In June/July 2005 I discovered a little plugin by Chris J Davis (http://www.chrisjdavis.org/cjd-notepad/) called notepad. I added a small feature to it (basically a bookmarklet).  In the process I started looking at his code and realized how much you could do with the plugin system available in Word Press.

So I decided to make an offical fork. I put up an article on my blog asking for new names. I picked Postie.  I then modified the code to be a proper plugin.  And the rest is history :)
