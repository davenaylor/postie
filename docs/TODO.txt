=========
Revised parsing logic

convert all logic to filters
before session filter
before mail filter
email/account filter
attachment filter
iterate through each html element (p, div, etc) and apply all filters and buffer output
after mail filter
after session filter

convert plain text to html using same logic as wp - i.e. all text is html
Original text is never modified
