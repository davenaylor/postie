<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	<h4>Mail is not showing up right when I send html (rich formatted) e-mail!</h4>

<p>Make sure you set the preferred text type to html</p>

<h4>Do I need to any code to my theme for postie to work?</h4>

<p>No. </p>

<h4>I read somewhere to add an iframe to my footer. Should I do this?</h4>

<p>No. Do not add an iframe in your footer to get postie to check mail
periodically. To check e-mail periodically, either set-up a cron job, or use
cronless postie. See installation instructions</p>

<h4>My mail host requires SSL, but postie will not allow me to select pop3-ssl or imap-ssl</h4>

<p>You must have php-imap installed on your server for this to work. Ask your
hosting provider about this.</p>

<h4>Can I use postie to check a gmail account?</h4>

<p>Yes. You can use either pop3-ssl or imap-ssl with a gmail account. Before
attempting to use with postie, make sure that you enable pop or imap in your
gmail preferences.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pop3 settings:

<ul>
<li>protocol - pop3-ssl</li>
<li>server - pop.gmail.com</li>
<li>port - 995</li>
<li>userid - your username (e.g. if your e-mail address is foo@gmail.com,
this would be just foo)</li>
<li>password - your password </li>
</ul></li>
<li>IMAP settings:

<ul>
<li>protocol - imap-ssl</li>
<li>server - imap.gmail.com</li>
<li>port - 993</li>
<li>userid - your username (e.g. if your e-mail address is foo@gmail.com,
this would be just foo)</li>
<li>password - your password </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>My posts show up as being posted by 'admin' instead of me. Why?</h4>

<p>If your admin account is linked to bar@gmail.com, and you send mail from
bar@gmail.com, it will show up as being posted by admin. If you have a
wordpress user named "John Doe", which is linked to johndoe@gmail.com, make
sure that you send e-mails from johndoe@gmail.com. It doesn't matter which
e-mail address postie is checking. That is, if you send mail from
johndoe@gmail.com to foo@gmail.com, it gets posted as "John Doe". </p>

<p>If you send an e-mail to your postie address from an e-mail address that is no
t linked to a wordpress user, it will get posted as admin.</p>

<h4>Images aren't showing up at all?</h4>

<p>There are a couple possible reasons for this. First, check to see if you can
add an image through wordpress's normal posting mechanism. If not, then there
is probably 1 or 2 problems:
1. Your server does not have the php-gd library installed. Ask your hosting
provider about this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your wp-content/uploads directory is not writable by the webserver. Make
sure that it is</li>
</ol>

<h4>Can I delete the wp-files directory needed by postie version &lt;1.3.0?</h4>

<p>If you have posts published already by older versions of postie, getting rid
of those directories will delete any files you might have had associated with
those old posts. If you don't have any such posts, then you can safely delete
them.</p>

<h4>How can I get rid of stupid stuff my e-mail provider adds to my messages?</h4>

<p>To strip off stuff that they add at the beginning of a message, start your
post with :start</p>

<p>To strip off stuff that they add at the end of a message, end your
post with :end</p>

<h4>How can I add custom attachment icons?</h4>

<p>Simply upload the icons you want to the postie/icons/custom directory. You
must name the icons according to the following scheme:
-.png</p>

<p>For example, for word documents, you could use:
    doc-32.png
for a 32x32 pixel icon. (You can actually create any size icon you want, but
if you name it 32, then it will only be used if you select to use size 32
icons)</p>

<p>See the other directories in icons for more examples.</p>

<p>Currently the following filetypes are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li>doc - microsoft word (including docx)</li>
<li>ppt - microsoft powerpoint (including pptx)</li>
<li>xls - microsoft excel (including xlsx)</li>
<li>numbers - iWork numbres spreadsheet</li>
<li>pages - iWork pages document</li>
<li>key - iWork keynote presentation</li>
<li>pdf - portable document format</li>
<li>rtf - rich text format</li>
<li>txt - plain text document</li>
</ul>
