<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	<h4>Mail is not showing up right when I send html (rich formatted) e-mail!</h4>

<p>Make sure you set the preferred text type to html</p>

<h4>Do I need to any code to my theme for postie to work?</h4>

<p>No. </p>

<h4>I read somewhere to add an iframe to my footer. Should I do this?</h4>

<p>No. Do not add an iframe in your footer to get postie to check mail
periodically. To check e-mail periodically, either set-up a cron job, or use
cronless postie. See installation instructions</p>

<p>= My mail host requires SSL, but postie will not allow me to select pop3-ssl
or imap-ssl =</p>

<p>You must have php-imap installed on your server for this to work. Ask your
hosting provider about this.</p>

<h4>Can I use postie to check a gmail account?</h4>

<p>Yes. You can use either pop3-ssl or imap-ssl with a gmail account. Before
attempting to use with postie, make sure that you enable pop or imap in your
gmail preferences.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pop3 settings:

<ul>
<li>protocol - pop3-ssl</li>
<li>server - pop.gmail.com</li>
<li>port - 995</li>
<li>userid - your username (e.g. if your e-mail address is foo@gmail.com,
this would be just foo)</li>
<li>password - your password </li>
</ul></li>
<li>IMAP settings:

<ul>
<li>protocol - imap-ssl</li>
<li>server - imap.gmail.com</li>
<li>port - 993</li>
<li>userid - your username (e.g. if your e-mail address is foo@gmail.com,
this would be just foo)</li>
<li>password - your password </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>My posts show up as being posted by 'admin' instead of me. Why?</h4>

<p>If your admin account is linked to bar@gmail.com, and you send mail from
bar@gmail.com, it will show up as being posted by admin. If you have a
wordpress user named "John Doe", which is linked to johndoe@gmail.com, make
sure that you send e-mails from johndoe@gmail.com. It doesn't matter which
e-mail address postie is checking. That is, if you send mail from
johndoe@gmail.com to foo@gmail.com, it gets posted as "John Doe". </p>

<p>If you send an e-mail to your postie address from an e-mail address that is no
t linked to a wordpress user, it will get posted as admin.</p>

<h4>Images aren't showing up at all?</h4>

<p>There are a couple possible reasons for this. First, check to see if you can
add an image through wordpress's normal posting mechanism. If not, then there
is probably 1 or 2 problems:
1. Your server does not have the php-gd library installed. Ask your hosting
provider about this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your wp-content/uploads directory is not writable by the webserver. Make
sure that it is</li>
